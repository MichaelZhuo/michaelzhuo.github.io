Hello,

My name is Michael, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the topic of “a complete man.”

I will delve into this concept from three main perspectives: what truly constitutes a complete man, how we can achieve this ideal, and the compelling reasons why we should strive for it. With that in mind, I will now commence my speech.

To begin, I will provide a definition of the concept. In ancient China, philosophers referred to a complete man as a “Junzi,” a figure embodying virtues and wisdom. A Junzi possesses the remarkable ability of Self-Cultivation, the skill of Family Regulation, the authority of State Governance, and the unwavering pursuit of peace for all under heaven. In modern times, Deng Xiaoping emphasized the significance of individuals with Holistic Education, who possess a well-rounded development encompassing moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetic, and labor aspects. From my perspective, a complete man aligns seamlessly with this definition.
